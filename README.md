# ÇiftçiMobil - Smart Agricultural Management System 🚜📱

**ÇiftçiMobil** is a comprehensive system analysis and design project developed to optimize agricultural activities, bridge the communication gap between farmers and agricultural directorates, and enable data-driven farming decisions.

This project was documented for the **YBS201 System Analysis and Design** course at **Bilecik Şeyh Edebali University**.

## 🎯 Project Overview & Problem Statement

Agricultural activities often suffer from inefficiency due to a lack of data-driven planning. Farmers struggle with:
* **Supply/Demand Mismatch:** Difficulty in choosing the right crops based on market needs.
* **Uncontrollable Factors:** Sudden weather changes (floods, droughts) without early warning.
* **Communication Gaps:** Lack of direct channels with the Agriculture Directorate.
* **Resource Management:** Inefficient use of water and soil due to lack of education.

**çiftçiMobil** addresses these issues by creating a digital platform that provides real-time data, educational resources, and direct communication channels.

## 💡 Key Features

* **🌍 Regional Analysis:** Farmers can register their fields (Province/District/Village) to receive localized advice.
* **🌦️ Smart Alerts:** Early warnings for weather conditions like frost, hail, or storms.
* **🛒 Agricultural Marketplace:** A secure platform for trading seeds, fertilizers, and equipment.
* **📉 Expense & Income Calculator:** Tools to track farming costs and estimated profits.
* **👨‍⚕️ Ask an Expert:** Direct communication line with agricultural experts for problem-solving.
* **📢 News & Campaigns:** Up-to-date agricultural news and government incentive files.

## 🛠️ Technical Feasibility & Tools

The system is designed to be cross-platform, ensuring accessibility for all farmers.

* **UI/UX Design:** Designed using **Figma**.
* **Programming Languages:** C# and C++ (planned for development).
* **Platforms:** Android & iOS (Mobile), Web Interface.
* **System Requirements:** Requires internet connectivity, GPS location services, and basic smartphone capabilities (3GB+ Storage, 1GB+ RAM).

## 📊 System Analysis & Design Artifacts

The project documentation includes detailed analysis deliverables:

### 1. Planning & Feasibility
* **Feasibility Studies:** Institutional, Legal (KVKK/GDPR compliance), Financial, and Technical feasibility reports.
* **Timeline:** Project management utilizing **Gantt Charts** and **CPM/PERT** diagrams (Critical Path Method) to ensure a 26-week completion timeline.

### 2. Modeling
* **DFD (Data Flow Diagrams):**
    * *Logical DFD:* Mapping the flow of user data, reports, and complaints.
    * *Conceptual DFD:* High-level view of the interaction between the Farmer and the Agriculture Directorate.

### 3. Interface Design (UI)
Mockups were created for Login screens, Dashboard, Marketplace, and Profile management for both **iOS** and **Android** environments.
